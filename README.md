picobot-GA--Java-
=================

Same goal as my picobot-GA project, except I rewrote this one in Java. This hopefully will become an applet 
that can run on its own at some point. It could also spawn off a Picobot simulator, because simulating 
Picobot is a necessary part of the genetic algorithm, so I've already done that.
